# Sign Language Detection 🖐️🤟

A **real-time Sign Language Detection system** built using **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**.  
This project bridges the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and others by recognizing sign language gestures through a webcam.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔤 Detects **hand gestures** and maps them to **sign language alphabets/words**.  
- 🎥 Works in **real-time** using webcam or video input.  
- 🧠 Powered by **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** trained on sign language datasets.  
- 🖼️ Uses **OpenCV** for image preprocessing and detection.  
- ⚡ Lightweight and fast, runs on CPU (GPU optional).
